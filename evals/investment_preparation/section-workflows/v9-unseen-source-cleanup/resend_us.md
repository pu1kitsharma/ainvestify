Unknown economics: What income does the investment entity retain from Transactional Email API, and does it cover attributable variable service costs? Published statements do not establish realized income; reconcile the contracting entity, recognition and company-held cost records.

Sources: [S1](#source-s1), [S2](#source-s2), [S3](#source-s3)

### Opportunity and unresolved risks

Status: complete

Reason to engage: If retained income from Transactional Email API covers attributable variable delivery costs and eligible Transactional Email API customers record completed order, the evidence could support further diligence on a repeatable business. Both conditions require reconciled company records.

Unresolved risk: The commercial case weakens if the variable cost of delivering Transactional Email API consumes its retained income. The proposed reconciliation will distinguish partner charges and delivery costs before identifying pricing or cost work.

Next decision: Resolve the linked contribution and customer-use questions before recommending an engagement or expansion; investigate adverse results and leave missing inputs unresolved.

Question to explore: What income does the investment entity retain from Transactional Email API, and does it cover attributable variable service costs?

Sources: [S1](#source-s1), [S2](#source-s2)

### The assistance we propose

Status: complete

Proposed work: We propose a contribution reconciliation and customer analysis for the Transactional Email API, utilizing accounting records including entity chart, service/fee-sharing agreements, redacted invoices, revenue ledger, and supplier invoices, alongside redacted account-event and customer/cohort exports. The concrete deliverable is a source-linked contribution profit table and a cohort rate table, supporting the commercial decision to investigate loss-making services and select the next activation or retention investigation. We request redacted account-event and customer/cohort exports for the Transactional Email API, containing stable customer keys, event types, timestamps, plan details, and completion/cancellation status, with anonymized customer IDs and dates.

Invitation: Invite a conversation with one question: Are you available to discuss the data requirements for this analysis?

Sources: [S1](#source-s1), [S2](#source-s2)

## Diligence request

### First diligence request

Status: complete

Question: What income does the investment entity retain from Transactional Email API, and does it cover attributable variable service costs?

Records to request: Entity chart and service/fee-sharing agreements; redacted invoices, credit notes, revenue ledger, collection and partner-settlement statements. Include entity, plan, account key, month, currency, refunds and taxes. Reconcile recognition and gross/net presentation; identify any partner charges already deducted and normalize them exactly once. Exclude customer principal, assets and pass-through taxes from revenue.; Supplier invoices, direct service/support cost records and staff-time allocations for the same entity, plans, accounts and months. Include currency, expense category, allocation basis and one-off versus ongoing service cost. Exclude fixed corporate overhead and partner charges already deducted from the reconciled revenue input. Request missing records; do not estimate them from public tariffs.

Decision: Decision unresolved until the requested records and definitions are checked. Use reconciled contribution to investigate loss-making services and choose pricing or delivery-cost work before an expansion recommendation. Observed losses alone do not establish future viability.

Proposed analysis: Recognized service revenue after partner charges, if applicable (reconciled reporting currency) − Attributable variable service costs excluding partner charges already deducted (reconciled reporting currency). Scope: Investment target, legal identity and contracting entities to confirm; Transactional Email API; Eligible service accounts, separated by plan and operating month. Align records to Latest six completed months; exposure: Complete operating month. Check definitions and reconcile inputs before calculating; leave missing inputs and zero denominators unresolved.

Deliverable: A source-linked contribution profit table (reconciled reporting currency) with input reconciliation, definitions and unresolved differences.

Sources: [S1](#source-s1), [S2](#source-s2)

### Second diligence request

Status: complete

Question: What proportion of eligible new Transactional Email API customers record completed order within the requested observation window?

Records to request: Redacted account-event export with stable customer key, event type, event timestamp, plan and completion/cancellation status. Count each eligible customer once if completed order occurs after registration within follow-up. Link to the eligible cohort file; missing event coverage is unresolved, not a negative outcome.; Redacted customer/cohort export with stable customer key, registration/enrollment/first-event date, plan, eligibility flags and data cutoff. Cohort entry is registration; document eligibility exclusions before counting. Use the same cohort and customer keys as the event export; retain only fully observed customers.

Decision: Decision unresolved until the requested records and definitions are checked. Use measured customer participation to select the next activation or retention investigation; set an experiment threshold from an observed baseline.

Proposed analysis: Customers completing the specified activation event (unique customers) ÷ Eligible newly registered customers with complete follow-up (unique customers). Scope: Investment target, legal identity and service operator to confirm; Transactional Email API; Same eligible customer cohort, grouped by entry month and service plan. Align records to Latest six completed months; exposure: First ninety days after cohort entry; exclude immature accounts. Check definitions and reconcile inputs before calculating; leave missing inputs and zero denominators unresolved.

Deliverable: A source-linked cohort rate table (fraction) with input reconciliation, definitions and unresolved differences.
